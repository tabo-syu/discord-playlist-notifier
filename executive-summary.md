   - Mixed Japanese and English in code comments and user messages
   - No proper internationalization support

3. **Performance Issues**:
   - Inefficient database queries
   - Suboptimal string handling
   - No caching for YouTube API responses

4. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Suboptimal Docker configuration
   - No health checks or restart policies

## Recommendations

We have prepared a comprehensive set of recommendations to address these issues, organized into three documents:

1. **[README-analysis.md](README-analysis.md)**: A detailed analysis of all issues found in the codebase.
2. **[code-improvements.md](code-improvements.md)**: Specific code examples and recommendations for addressing each issue.
3. **[action-plan.md](action-plan.md)**: A prioritized action plan for addressing the issues in order of importance.
4. **[test-plan.md](test-plan.md)**: A comprehensive test plan to verify the application's functionality and catch any issues.
